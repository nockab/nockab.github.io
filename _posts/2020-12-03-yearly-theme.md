As the year ends it's time to set up a sailing course for the next 12 months. I've become a believer in yearly themes, not resolutions, after years of listening to the Cortex podcast. A theme does make sense - it shows direction not destination, so you do what you do and try to keep the course.

My theme of the New Year will be...

# 2021 - Year of Algoritmization
## 2020 - Year of Focus
### 2019 - Year of Productivity

[//]: # (Todo: Write a review of 2020 - Year of Focus)

This comes from few things.

I'm finishing Yuval Noah Harari's book *Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow* and he provides interesting ideas about how we humans, just as every other animal or even plant are acting based on complicated algorithms that are developed inside of us by evolution.

I'd like to be consistent with my tasks. It could be work-related or personal. Writing a procedure for tasks that aren't done often may result in faster completion in the future. And what is even better - I may even automate it.

So... First of all, I hope that 2021 will be better than 2020 for all of us.
