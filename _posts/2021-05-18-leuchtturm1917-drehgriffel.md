# Fountain pen love

I fell in love with fountain pens 5 years ago. My first was Lamy Safari, then
multiple chinese Baoer pens, fountain Parker Jotter and some others.
I like them, but I'm not obsessed. It was (and still is) love but it
is not mutual. Ink takes a while to dry, it needs good quality paper or it feathers,
whole page can get accidentaly wiped with wet hands.

So.. 5 years later, here comes the ballpoint.

# Drehgriffel
Leuchtturm1917 Drehgriffel is ballpoint pen, that accepts Parker G2 type refills.
It's on small and light side, but made from metal. It has really nice triangular
package, that, when opened, reveals nice quote:

"Writing by hand is thinking on paper. Thoughts grow into words, sentences and pictures.
Memories become stories. Ideas are transformed into projects. Notes inspire insight,
We write and understand, learn, see and **think - with the hand.**"
