I fell in love with fountain pens 5 years ago. My first was Lamy Safari, then
multiple chinese Baoer pens, fountain Parker Jotter and some others.
I like them, but I'm not obsessed. It was (and still is) love but it
is not mutual. Ink takes a while to dry, it needs good quality paper or it feathers,
whole page can get accidentaly wiped with wet hands.

So.. 5 years later, here comes the ballpoint.

## Drehgriffel

Leuchtturm1917 Drehgriffel is ballpoint pen, that accepts Parker G2 type refills.
It's on small and light side, but made from metal. It has really nice triangular
package, that, when opened, reveals nice quote:

> "Writing by hand is thinking on paper. Thoughts grow into words, sentences and pictures.
Memories become stories. Ideas are transformed into projects. Notes inspire insight,
We write and understand, learn, see and **think - with the hand.**"

### Refills

There are many available. Saving this list for personal reference:

There is the option of oil-based ballpoint ink, hybrid ink, or gel.

For oil-based ballpoint ink:
* Schmidt P900
* Monteverde Soft Roll series.


For hybrid ink:
* Uni Jetstream SXR-600 Series
* Schmidt EasyFlow 9000


For a gel refill:
* Monteverde capless gel ceramic rollerball
* Itoya and OHTO also make a gel also. Both are needle points. The OHTO does not come in a broad point.
