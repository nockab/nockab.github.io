I fell in love with fountain pens 5 years ago. My first was Lamy Safari, then multiple Chinese Baoer pens, fountain Parker Jotter, and some others. I like them, but I’m not obsessed. It was (and still is) love but it is not mutual. Ink takes a while to dry, it needs good quality paper or its feathers, the whole page can get accidentally wiped with wet hands.

So.. 5 years later, here comes the ballpoint.

## Drehgriffel

Leuchtturm1917 Drehgriffel is ballpoint pen, that accepts Parker G2 type refills. It’s on the small and light side but made from metal. It has a nice triangular package, that, when opened, reveals a nice quote:

> “Writing by hand is thinking on paper. Thoughts grow into words, sentences, and pictures. Memories become stories. Ideas are transformed into projects. Notes inspire insight, We write and understand, learn, see and **think - with the hand.**”

### Refills
There are many available. Saving this list for personal reference:

There is the option of oil-based ballpoint ink, hybrid ink, or gel.

For oil-based ballpoint ink:
* Schmidt P900
* Monteverde Soft Roll series.

For hybrid ink:
* Uni Jetstream SXR-600 Series
* Schmidt EasyFlow 9000

For a gel refill:
* Monteverde capless gel ceramic rollerball (using black one for 6 months and this refill is 🔥🔥🔥)
* Itoya and OHTO also make a gel. Both are needle points. The OHTO does not come in a broad point.
