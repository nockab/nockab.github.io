I was dreaming for it for a long time, to have some kind of miny keyboard that will go with an iPad mini and could be used almost as a regular laptop. I’ve researched a lot of different options, but there were none “ideal” solutions.

When working from home I’ve got used to use iPad mini as my go-to meeting device - Skype, Zoom, MS Teams, whatever. It has good enough camera, connects to AirPods and I can stand it wherever I am. So if it’s multiple hour long meeting, I can freely change locations.

This review is written, edited and published using exclusively my portable setup.

For iPad devices there is nothng better than Apple designed stuff. Unfortunately (or luckily, considering the price), there is no any kind of Apple keyboard that can go with iPad mini 5. It’s 2021, everyone is reviewing iPad mini 6, so there probably won’t be much new exercises for older mini.

## What is in the setup?
### Hardware
1. **iPad mini**– 5-th generation (2019, WiFi+Cellular, 64 GB)
2. **Apple Pencil** – 1-st gen, works great for note taking, sketching, photo mark-up and reading pointer
3. **ZAGG tri-fold keyboard** – this is new and because of it I’m writing this post. I’ve got German layout (it was 60% cheaper!), and there is some learning curve, I still am mixing up some symbols, keys and letters. It can switch between two devices, so I can use it with iPad and phone.
4. **AirPods Pro** – with iPad using in meetings or to play ambient music that helps focus (with two kids, it does not help as much as I’d want to).

### Software
1. **Drafts** – for meeting note writing
2. **Obsidian** – as personal knowledge base, it’s fantastic for working with markdown files and jumping from one note to another. Syncs with iOS, iPadOS, macOS and Windows devices via Dropbox as bunch of .md files.
3. **1Writer** – for blog post writing. I could use native Notes app, Obsidian or Drafts. But I’ve bought it before Obsidian came out for iOS, and I like it a lot.

### Update

From the box keyboards touch pad scroll direction was opposite as on Mac and CMD and Option keys were swapped. Thanks to iPadOS, it was very easy to swap them around:

```
Settings\Keyboard\Hardware keyboard\Modifier keys
```

At first I tried to adapt and re-wire muscle memory – wasn't necessary.
