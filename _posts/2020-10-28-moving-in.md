I've tried multiple times to start a blog. But usually, it all ends here - I'm moving in, writing the first couple of posts, then maintaining blog becomes too difficult and it all goes where it came from. I hope, that I have somewhere collection of my old writings, so I can re-use them here.

But the main purpose of this "blog" is to make my work and life better. If it helps someone else - that would be amazing. But we are starting in small steps.

I will use this blog post to keep a list of things I should do to make this place better. And the list of future posts that are the reason I've started all this again.

## Work Plan (Technical)
* Finish setting up [Jekyll][getting-started]
* Work on style-sheets and layouts
* Add light-dark mode (switchable and automatic)

## Writing Plan
* Hybrid Productivity System - how I use my notebook and phone to plan my year, weeks, and days. Planning, organizing, prioritizing and doing.
* Personal budget - why to do it and how to do it with a simple Google Spreadsheet.
* Making daily tasks simpler with automation - Shortcuts (iOS), Keyboard Maestro (macOS), AutoHotkey (Windows).
* and more
