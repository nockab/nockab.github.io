In the realm of analogue note-taking and task management, I've discovered a system that resonates with me. Let's dive right into it without a lengthy preamble.

## Simplicity in Tools

For this system, all you need are a few simple tools:

- **Pocketable ballpoint pen:** I personally use the Zebra FxMD.
- **A5 notebook:** for example, Leuchttrum1917 A5 dot-grid.
- **Pocket-sized notebook:** Somehing like Field Notes is a great choice.

## The Concept: Two Notebooks, One Pen

The A5 journal sometimes feels cumbersome to carry around, often getting left at my desk. Turning to phone notes introduces distractions, and notes can easily be forgotten once the app is closed.

## Purpose of the Small Notebook

This pocket-sized companion serves as a catch-all inbox. Opt for a small notebook that fits snugly into your pocket, easily accessible whenever inspiration strikes.

I've experimented with various options, including the [Rhodia A7 Pocket Size Side-Stapled Notebook](https://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_classic_stapled_A7.php) with a custom stitched felt cover featuring a pen loop. Currently, I've fashioned my DIY [Hipster PDA](https://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda), a compact notepad with a 3D printed back cover, ensuring it's always at my fingertips. The Zebra pen neatly secures at the top, making it an ideal on-the-go companion.

My selection of the Zebra pen stems from its exceptional qualities—it's an all-metal, sturdy, everyday carry (EDC) pen with impeccable writing performance. Admittedly, sourcing refills locally has proven challenging, but the pen's quality and reasonable price make it a worthwhile investment. Losing it would prompt me to order a replacement without hesitation.

I carry this "notebook" everywhere. Whether it's an idea, thought, task, or a useful nugget of information, my reflex is to log it here. The first page is always reserved for spontaneous input, and I use 1-2 pages daily based on my needs.

Once I'm at my desk, I efficiently transfer these entries to their designated spots in my larger journal or task management system.

## Managing Tasks Efficiently

While many of my entries find their way from the Hipster PDA to my larger system, some tasks or notes remain confined to the pocket-sized companion. If a task proves irrelevant or is swiftly completed, it might not make it farther than the Hipster PDA.

Additionally, I've discovered the effectiveness of a single A7 page for time-blocking. Utilizing Cal Newport's method, I divide the page into three columns, offering a practical approach to planning workdays with the flexibility to make real-time adjustments.

## The Large Notebook: A Haven for Deliberate Thought

In contrast, the large notebook serves as a classic, unpretentious Bullet Journal, capturing my daily tasks and the unfolding events around me. Occasionally, I delve into more contemplative subjects like my thoughts on books, planning ideas, memorable quotes, blog post concepts, and more.

I've adopted a fountain pen for this notebook, embracing the deliberate pace it imposes. The ink's slower drying time encourages me to be slow, concise, and precise—ensuring thoughtful reflection with every stroke.
