I love programming. I'm not good at it, but I'd like to get better. Programming is fun (sometimes not), and it's really useful.

My day job is not about writing code. But using [Python](https://www.python.org) and [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) I've managed to automate big chunk of my daily tasks. I complete my tasks faster and there is less possibility of error, because my work output is consistent.

I loved to play games. I don't get to play them now. It's been a long while. When I've became dad, priorities switched. And when second kid arrived, there is no such luxury to have half an hour for playing. I have Red Dead Redemption 2 on my Xbox One uncompleted for a long while. Yeah. I have Xbox One and own two games – Assasins Creed: Origin and RDR2. That's it. No time to play even those two. There is still hope that someday, when kids will grow...

So I thought... Maybe I can combine two things that are bringing me joy. I need to train my brain muscle more. I'm getting older, so this will be harder in the future.

I'm not good story teller. I'm bad at programming. I've no experience in game dev.

By documenting my steps in this blog, in future posts I hope to fix it.
