<p>Thing are not that bad as we think they are. If there are horrible news and frightening numbers - always dig deeper, compare them to previous years numbers or overall statistics. We think binary - good/bad, but word around us is mostly somewhere in the middle. There is no US and THEY, world is split in 4 income levels and most of the world is in the middle, not in the poorest. World is evolving but our knowledge of the world is very outdated.</p>
