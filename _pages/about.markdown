## Hi!

This blog is still in the oven, so there is nowhere to subscribe. I use social sites just for reading and learning something new, so this blog is the only* place where I write.


Dad of two, working as a Data protection officer (DPO) with geeky and strange hobbies: programming and reading. I'm here on my journey to automate boring processes, tinker with tools, and sometimes dive into topics way harder than the average person.


I love technology and enjoy analog stuff. Tech is growing and evolving way faster than a regular human being can keep on track. So, to stay focused and sober in such a fast-paced and rapidly changing world, I've started this blog - to collect practices, that can slow your life down, get back focus from AI-produced distractions, return more meaning and personality in life.
