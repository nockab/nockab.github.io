## Hi!

I only use social sites to read and learn, so this blog is the only* place I write.

Information security and privacy professional with hobbies of cooking, programming and reading. I'm here on my journey to automate boring processes, tinker with tools and sometimes dive into new topics.

I love technology and analogue things. Technology is growing and evolving much faster than a normal person can keep up with. So, in order to stay focused and sober in such a fast-paced and rapidly changing world, I've started this blog - to collect practices that can slow down your life, regain focus from AI-produced distractions, and bring back more meaning and personality to life.

All posts here are written by me. I only use AI for proofreading, as English is not my first or second language.
