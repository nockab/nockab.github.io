# About
Hi! I love technology and enjoy analogue things. Recently tech started to grow and evolute way faster than regular human being is able to keep in track. So, to stay focused and sober in such fast paced and rapidly changing world, I've started this blog - to collect practices, that can slow your life down, get back focus from AI produced distractions, return more meaning and personality in life.

## P.S.
I'm not sure if I need to have this page on the site. But I'll let it stay here for some while.
